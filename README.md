## LEARNING UPDATE
I was able to expand on my knowledge of CSS animation, learning how to properly move elements around on the screen while also cleaning them up once they were no longer needed.
I also now better understand how to handle large numbers broken up with commas when using them in calculations, switching back and forth between strings and numbers.
